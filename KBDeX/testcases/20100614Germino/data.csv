1,F1,so we need lambda and its give us the *** so with the wavelength we can find velocity.  And with...  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,F4,And we don't have to work with the-work-function right away. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,F1,not right away but we do need the-work-function at the end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,F4,Ok to find the... ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,F1, Because the important thing that for the lambda we are find the wavelength of the electron not of light.     ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,F4,"Right, exactly.  So, first for the electron we use planck / mass  velocity because we know the mass of an  electron",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,F1,We need to find the mass of an electron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,F4," no, we know the mass of an electron. It's an electron.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,F1,"very true, very true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,F4,but we don't know... ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,F1,with this wavelength we would be find velocity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,F2,"what did they give us.  For the following wavelength. So, well lambda equal planck / mass velocity right? ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,F1,Yes its tell us to use lambda equal planck / mass velocity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,F1,You can find energy-k. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,F4,energy-k of a photon. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,F1,Use energy-k of the-work-function equal energy-k equal planck new minus the-work-function equal energy-k of a photon  and use energy-k of a photon to find the wavelength of light.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,F4,ok... We're doing A right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,F4," so first, energy-k of a photon we are find first.  What are we find first? ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,F1,We need to find first the velocity unless you've find velocity already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,F4,No I haven't find velocity already. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,F1,"ok, so lambda equal planck / mass velocity, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,F2,no wait lambda equal planck / mass velocity is the lambda .  lambda equal planck / mass velocity is to find the eject electron.  I'm sure you probably use the energy-k first. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,F4,You have to find planck speed . energy-p that's planck speed / lambda which we are give. 2.5x10^-7 meter so that is... ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,F2,"oh, they give us the-work-function because we have to  find if energy-k is greater than zero so that we can say that 1 electron is equal to 1 photon.  Do you remember like before. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,F1,no photon is eject electron.  We do need the-work-function to find energy-k.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,F2, oh.  Ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,F1,so did you get 7.95x10^-19?   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,F4,7.92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,F1,close enough. Right.  So now we do energy-k equal energy-p minus the-work-function ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,F4,energy-p minus the-work-function yep.  So 7.92x10^-19 minus 6.6x10^-19 joules.  And those are all joules.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,F2,what did you get for energy-p? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,F4, did you get 92 or 95? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,F2, I didn't do 92 95.  I will though. I just like to get-down everything .   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,F4,ok 1.32x10^-19 joules.  So now  use energy-k you can find.   energy-k equal 1/2 mass velocity ^2 Åc You can find velocity and then find lambda. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,F1&4,yeah ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,F4,are you with us? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,F2,not at all. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,F4,"ok, we have energy-k,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,F2,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,F4,We know energy-k that equal 1/2 mass velocity ^2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,F2,energy-k that equal 1/2 mass velocity ^2 does equal velocity. You are awesome. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,F4,I'm tell  you we're done with our storm.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,F4,We are performe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,F1,we are use  the mass of an electron correct? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,F's2&4,is 9.11x10^-31 kgs. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,F2,9.11x10^-31 kgs.  Where did we get 9.11x10^-31 kgs from? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,F4, 9.11x10^-31 kgs is a constant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,F1,mass of an electron. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,F4,we are just so freaking smart.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,F4,"velocity ^2 and then, velocity ^2 is...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,F1,"ok, I get...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,F4, velocity ^2 is  2. Or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,F2,I'm get ... ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,F4,velocity ^2 is  2 doesn't make-sense.  *** is going to be an ugly number.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,F1,when is it not an ugly number?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,F4, I get  5.38 x10^5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,F1, yes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,F4,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yep ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,F1,you can change 5.38x10^5 into scientific notation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,F2,can you really? How do you do change 5.38x10^5 into scientific notation)? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,F1,I don't know how to do change 5.38x10^5 into scientific notation on your calculator. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,F4,x 10^5 meter per second is velocity and...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,F2&4,...then lambda equal planck / mass velocity finally. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,F2,10^5 right?  And then what? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,F2&4, .. lambda equal planck / mass velocity. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,F2,10^5 th ? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,F4,yep. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,F2,And then what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,F4, And then lambda equal 6.626 x ...  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,F2,"Alright, the mass is what, this mass? ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,F4,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of an electron.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,F2,is that the same 9.11? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,F4,yep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,F4, I get 1.35x10^ *** I just ***,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,F1,it was 10^- *** it was something different.  It would be 1x10^-10.  Are you sure you are count right? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,F4," 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  Yes.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,F1,So its 1^-9th? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,F4,no 10^-9th.  1x10^-9th.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,F1,ok.  You say 10.   1x10^-9 is the same exact answer.  Are you are trying to confuse me?  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,F4,answer is what I get  too.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,F1,lambda is 1.35x10^-9. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,F4, well ok ***,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,F1, IÅfve been up to the board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
